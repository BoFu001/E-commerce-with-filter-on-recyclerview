# Technical Assessment


## :scroll: Description
Hello, I'm Bo Fu. I tried my best to complete this Android technical assignment. Due to the short time available, my app is still simple, but I really feel satisfied because I implemented everything described from the link in the way I wanted. This application I wrote totally in Kotlin language and MVVM design pattern. The first page shows a list of products which can be enriched with new items when user scroll it down to bottom. I also handled no connection situation adding a retry button both in first loading and scroll loading. The list can be filtered by brand name or by category. In the second page you can see a collapsing header with parallax effect, and in the nested page the details of product are displayed. The link of the detailed infomation is an static link without any parameter I don't know why but I just followed the instruction. Thank you for your time and attention evaluation my assignment.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
As a passionate Android developer I am always attentive and careful about new technological trends. I think working in YOOX is a good occasion to learn new mobile tecnologies and learn from other skillful developers and I am also willing to share my experience in order to improve YOOX app as well as create new features.
